# Online Sneaker Store Classification Tool

![Alt text](<Django App.png>)

## Introduction
In today’s competitive online retail environment, customer reviews are more than just feedback; they are influential pieces of information that can significantly affect a potential buyer’s decision. For an online sneaker store, these reviews are a rich source of insights that, if analyzed effectively, can lead to improved customer satisfaction and refined marketing strategies. However, manually sifting through thousands of reviews to gauge customer sentiment is impractical and time-consuming. It is challenging for store managers to quickly and accurately understand the sentiment behind customer feedback and to act accordingly. The problem this project aims to solve is: How can the online sneaker store automate the process of analysing and understanding the sentiment behind customer reviews, and how can this analysis be seamlessly integrated into the store’s website for real-time insights? To address this problem, this project proposes the development and deployment of a Sentiment Analysis Service. This service will use a pre-trained machine learning model to automatically analyze customer reviews and categorise them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The analysis will be exposed through an API and integrated into the store’s existing e-commerce website. This solution aims to enable the store to respond more effectively to customer feedback, enhance user engagement, and ultimately drive business improvements based on data-driven insights.

## DATA DESCRIPTION
The Sneakers Reviews Dataset is a pre-collected set of customer reviews for various sneaker products sold by an online store. This dataset(Sneakers Reviews Dataset) is provided in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format, making it easy to import into various data analysis tools and programming environments.
